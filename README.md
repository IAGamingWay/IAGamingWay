üìù About Me
My name is IA and I am passionate about technology. I love everything related to PCs, consoles, smartwatches, and more. I have been using computers since I was four years old, and every day, my knowledge of technology continues to grow. I enjoy listening to hip-hop rap/trap/drill music and my favorite YouTuber is 2J, aka Giorgos Ioannou. Additionally, I have some knowledge of video editing, audio basics, and image editing.
